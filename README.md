## About The Project <a name = "about-the-project"></a>

NutriTrack presents an intuitive interface for retrieving nutritional information from an extensive food database. Its dynamic search feature provides real-time results as users type. Once users locate their desired food items, a simple click seamlessly adds them to the top table, where nutritional totals are dynamically aggregated. Users also have the option to contribute new food items to expand the existing database.
